Safe Driving app is a smart mobile application that combines real-time driver monitoring with artificial intelligence to ensure safer roads. The app starts with a secure login and registration system, followed by an interactive interface where drivers activate a front-facing camera. This camera is connected to AI models that detect drowsiness, distraction, or if the driver isn’t wearing a seatbelt, triggering instant alerts to prevent accidents.

The app is designed to serve both individual drivers and delivery companies. For individuals, it provides personal safety alerts and behavior tracking while driving. For companies, we developed a dedicated admin dashboard that allows full monitoring of all registered drivers — including their names, emails, current locations, and even their real-time behavior inside the vehicle. This helps delivery companies evaluate drivers' performance, ensure compliance with safety protocols, and improve accountability.

By combining AI-powered monitoring, a map-based interface, and a powerful dashboard, Safe Driving app offers a practical and effective tool for enhancing road safety on both the personal and business level.
